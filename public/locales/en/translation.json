  "home_page_description": "Hi, I am İlkim Sarıçimen Msc., a licensed psychologist currently based in the Netherlands. Having an online practice allows me to reach further beyond my physical practice and provide therapy to clients worldwide.\n\nAs someone who has lived in multiple countries before and is currently living abroad I know the unique mental health challenges being an international brings. So far I had the pleasure of working with humans-in-the being from different walks of life, encompassing different cultures, migration generations, age groups, and sexual orientations.\n\nI strongly believe therapy can support us in navigating through the waves of life by enhancing our psychological resilience.\n\nBy cultivating resilience we go beyond surviving the challenges, we transcend them. We learn to surf the waves, accept what we can’t change and change what we can’t accept.",
